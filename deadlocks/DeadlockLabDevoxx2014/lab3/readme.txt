The purpose of this lab is to solve a more difficult resource deadlock.  Your
boss wrote this code and is particularly proud of it.  Unfortunately the system
jams up after using it for a relatively short while.

0. To run the code you can either use the run.bat file or mvn -Prun. To compile
   you can use mvn install.

1. Run the code and try to figure out what you need to do to cause the deadlock.
   Get a stack trace of all your threads and see whether Java automatically
   finds this issue (it won't).

2. Look at the stack trace for threads that might be involved in the resource
   deadlock.

3. Solve the resource deadlock.

4. Verify that the program now does not jam up anymore.

Good luck!  You have 20 minutes to solve this lab.
